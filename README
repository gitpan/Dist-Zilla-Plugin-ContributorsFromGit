NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ContributorsFromGit - Populate your 'CONTRIBUTORS'
    POD from the list of git authors

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.014 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ContributorsFromGit - released July 05, 2014 as
    part of Dist-Zilla-Plugin-ContributorsFromGit.

SYNOPSIS
        ; in your dist.ini
        [ContributorsFromGit]

        ; in your weaver.ini
        [Contributors]

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin makes it easy to acknowledge the contributions of others by
    populating a %PodWeaver stash with the unique list of all git commit
    authors reachable from the current HEAD.

OVERVIEW
    On collecting the unique list of reachable commit authors from git, we
    search and remove any git authors from the list of authors Dist::Zilla
    knows about. We then look for a stash named %PodWeaver; if we don't find
    one then we create an instance of Dist::Zilla::Stash::PodWeaver and
    register it with our zilla instance. Then we add the list of
    contributors (the filtered git authors list) to the stash in such a way
    that Pod::Weaver::Section::Contributors can find them.

    Note that you do not need to have the %PodWeaver stash created; it will
    be added if it is not found. However, your Pod::Weaver config (aka
    c<weaver.ini>) must include the Contributors section plugin.

  Dist::Zilla Phase
    This plugin runs during the BeforeBuild phase.

  Metadata Keys
    The list of contributors is also added to distribution metadata under
    the custom "x_contributors" key. (e.g. in "META.yml", "META.json", etc)

    If you have duplicate contributors because of differences in committer
    name or email you can use a ".mailmap" file to canonicalize contributor
    names and emails. See git help shortlog for details.

  Pod::Weaver::Section::Contributors is OPTIONAL
    Note that using the Pod::Weaver::Section::Contributors section is in no
    way mandated or necessitated by this package; if you wish to use it you
    must include the Contributors section in your Pod::Weaver configuration
    in the traditional fashion.

METACPAN CONTRIBUTOR MATCHING
    MetaCPAN <http://metacpan.org> will attempt to match a contributor
    address back to a PAUSE account. However, it (currently) can only do
    that if the contributor's email address is their "PAUSEID@cpan.org"
    address. There are two mechanisms for helping to resolve this, if your
    commits are not using this address.

    Both of these approaches have pros and cons that have been discussed at
    levels nearing the heat brought to any discussion of religion,
    homosexuality, or Chief O'Brien's actual rank at any ST:TNG convention.
    However, they both have the advantage of *working*, and through
    different modes of action. You are free to use one, both or neither.
    These are only important if you're not committing with your "@cpan.org"
    email address and want the MetaCPAN to link to your author page from the
    page of the package you contributed to.

  Using a .mailmap file
    See "git help shortlog" for help on how to use this. A ".mailmap" file
    must be maintained in each repository using it.

  Globally, via the authors mapping
    This package contains a YAML file containing a mapping of "@cpan.org"
    author addresses; this list is consulted while building the contributors
    list, and can be used to replace a non-cpan.org address with one.

    To add to or modify this mapping, please feel free to fork, add your
    alternate email addresses to "share/author-emails.yaml", and submit a
    pull-request for inclusion. It'll be merged and released; as various
    authors update their set of installed modules and cut new releases, the
    mapping will appear.
