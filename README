NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ContributorsFromGit - Populate your 'CONTRIBUTORS'
    POD from the list of git authors

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.009 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ContributorsFromGit - released April 08, 2014 as
    part of Dist-Zilla-Plugin-ContributorsFromGit.

SYNOPSIS
        ; in your dist.ini
        [ContributorsFromGit]

        ; in your weaver.ini
        [Contributors]

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin makes it easy to acknowledge the contributions of others by
    populating a %PodWeaver stash with the unique list of all git commit
    authors reachable from the current HEAD.

OVERVIEW
    On collecting the unique list of reachable commit authors from git, we
    search and remove any git authors from the list of authors Dist::Zilla
    knows about. We then look for a stash named %PodWeaver; if we don't find
    one then we create an instance of Dist::Zilla::Stash::PodWeaver and
    register it with our zilla instance. Then we add the list of
    contributors (the filtered git authors list) to the stash in such a way
    that Pod::Weaver::Section::Contributors can find them.

    Note that you do not need to have the %PodWeaver stash created; it will
    be added if it is not found. However, your Pod::Weaver config (aka
    c<weaver.ini>) must include the Contributors section plugin.

    This plugin runs during the BeforeBuild phase.

    The list of contributors is also added to distribution metadata under
    the custom "x_contributors" key.

ATTRIBUTES
  author_emails
    This is an hash of additional emails that may be found from time to time
    in git commit logs mapped back to the author's 'canonical' author email.
    Generally speaking, the 'canonical email' will be the author's
    "@cpan.org" address, so that "metacpan" may properly attribute
    contributions.

    e.g.

        {
            'Chris Weyl <cweyl@alumni.drew.edu>' => 'Chris Weyl <rsrchboy@cpan.org>',
            'Chris Weyl <chris.weyl@wps.io>'     => 'Chris Weyl <rsrchboy@cpan.org>',
            ...
        }

    Note that this attribute is *read-only*; its contents are loaded from
    "share/author-emails.yaml". please fork and send a pull request if you'd
    like to add additional mappings. This is highly encouraged. :)

    If you have duplicate contributors because of differences in committer
    name or email you can use a ".mailmap" file to canonicalize contributor
    names and emails. See git help shortlog for details.
