NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ContributorsFromGit - Populate your 'CONTRIBUTORS'
    POD from the list of git authors

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ContributorsFromGit - released November 25, 2012 as
    part of Dist-Zilla-Plugin-ContributorsFromGit.

SYNOPSIS
        ; in your dist.ini
        [ContributorsFromGit]

        ; in your weaver.ini
        [Contributors]

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin makes it easy to acknowledge the contributions of others by
    populating a %PodWeaver stash with the unique list of all git commit
    authors reachable from the current HEAD.

OVERVIEW
    On collecting the unique list of reachable commit authors from git, we
    search and remove any git authors from the list of authors Dist::Zilla
    knows about. We then look for a stash named %PodWeaver; if we don't find
    one then we create an instance of Dist::Zilla::Stash::PodWeaver and
    register it with our zilla instance. Then we add the list of
    contributors (the filtered git authors list) to the stash in such a way
    that Pod::Weaver::Section::Contributors can find them.

    Note that you do not need to have the %PodWeaver stash created; it will
    be added if it is not found. However, your Pod::Weaver config (aka
    c<weaver.ini>) must include the Contributors section plugin.
